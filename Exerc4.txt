A sample Problem: Finding the Non-Duplicate
This question has been floating around as a tricky job interview quiestion for about a year now.
apologize if it doesn't have much pratical relevance beyond helping you get a high-paying job with lots of nice perks.

you are given a sorted array of nunbers where every value except one appears exactly twice; the remaining value apperars only once. Design an efficient algorithm
for finding which value appears only once.

Here are some example inputs to the problem:

1 1 2 2 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8
10 10 17 17 18 18 19 19 21 21 23
1 3 3 5 5 7 7 8 8 9 9 10 10
